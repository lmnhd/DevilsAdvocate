# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text for **Devil's Advocate**, embody a bold, provocative, and intellectually challenging persona.

## Brand Personality Keywords
* **Provocative** - Challenge assumptions, question consensus
* **Unapologetic** - Direct language, no hedging or softening
* **Intellectually Rigorous** - Cite sources, demand evidence
* **Dual-Minded** - Always present both perspectives
* **Darkly Humorous** - Wit and irony are welcome, but never at the expense of truth

## Voice Principles

### 1. Be Direct, Not Diplomatic
**❌ DON'T:** "We kindly suggest that you might want to consider..."  
**✅ DO:** "This claim needs evidence."

### 2. Embrace Tension
**❌ DON'T:** "Here's a balanced summary..."  
**✅ DO:** "Here's where they clash:"

### 3. Question Everything
**❌ DON'T:** "This is true."  
**✅ DO:** "Here's why this might be true. Here's why it might be false."

### 4. Use Active, Combat Language
**❌ DON'T:** "The analysis was performed..."  
**✅ DO:** "Agent A argues... Agent B counters..."

## Grammar & Mechanics

* **Headings:** Use Title Case for Agent names (Believer, Skeptic, Judge). Use sentence case for content.
* **Punctuation:** Use exclamation points ONLY for genuine emphasis in debate summaries. Avoid in error messages.
* **Clarity:** Prefer adversarial framing: "argues," "counters," "challenges," "defends."
* **Contractions:** Use them for conversational flow (e.g., "Here's" instead of "Here is").

## Terminology Guide

| Context | Don't Say | Say Instead |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result presentation | "Result" | "Verdict" or "Final Judgment" |
| Agent output | "Response" | "Argument" or "Case" |
| Process description | "Analyzing..." | "Debating..." |
| Confidence level | "Uncertain" | "Contested" |
| User input | "Submit" | "Challenge This" or "Put It to Trial" |

## Tone Adjustments by Context

### Error Messages
Be direct but helpful. Avoid blame.
**Example:** "This text is too short to debate. Add at least 50 characters."

### Onboarding
Be welcoming but set expectations for intellectual rigor.
**Example:** "Welcome. Pick a claim. We'll tear it apart from both sides."

### Results Summary
Be dramatic but data-driven.
**Example:** "Truth Confidence: 72%. The Believer made a strong case, but the Skeptic exposed three logical gaps."

## Writing Style Examples

### ✅ Good Copy
> **Believer's Case**  
> Argues that inflation is transitory based on historical precedent and Fed policy statements.
>
> **Skeptic's Rebuttal**  
> Counters with supply chain data showing structural issues that contradict the "transitory" narrative.

### ❌ Bad Copy
> **Analysis A**  
> Here is some information about inflation being temporary based on what experts say.
>
> **Analysis B**  
> However, there are other factors to consider that might suggest otherwise.

## Brand Phrases (Use These Consistently)

* "Put it to trial"
* "The verdict is in"
* "Believer vs. Skeptic"
* "Truth under fire"
* "Cognitive friction"
* "Both sides, full force"
* "No safe conclusions"

## Things to NEVER Say

* ❌ "Simple answer"

Instead, embrace the complexity and the conflict.
